NeoCLEAR: **Neo**natal **C**hampagne **L**umbar punctures **E**very time – **A**n **RC**T is a multicentre, randomised controlled trial to investigate techniques to increase lumbar puncture success in newborn babies. Lumbar puncture is a procedure performed to diagnose meningitis or another neurological condition, and sometimes as treatment for certain neurological problems. The main aim of the NeoCLEAR trial is to understand if there is a best technique for achieving a successful lumbar puncture in newborn babies, ‘best’ being defined as the technique which produces the clearest sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the fewest possible number of attempts.
