The NIHR PRU-Maternal and Neonatal Health and Care (PRU-MNHC) started in January 2019 and is funded by the Policy Research Programme at the Department of Health and Social Care (England). The PRU-MNHC is embedded in the NPEU with collaborations with the Universities of Birmingham, Leicester and Manchester and Imperial College in London to draw on policy-research expertise nationally and two PPPI collaborators to ensure high quality engagement with parents, patients and the public.  There are five themes to our work, with a series of projects being conducted under each theme. In addition, we have three cross-cutting themes embedded in all that we do: inequalities, mental health and social care. Our planned programme of work seeks to provide high quality, robust scientific evidence to inform national policy and practice. As a consequence, our research team addresses both enduring questions in maternal and neonatal health and care, as well as completing rapid responsive work to answer pressing policy questions.
