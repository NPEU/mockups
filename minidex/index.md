Minidex: *The efficacy and safety of very low dose dexamethasone used to facilitate the extubation of ventilator dependent preterm babies who are at high risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.*

Minidex is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing low dose dexamethasone to placebo for premature babies who are breathing with the support of a ventilator. We would like to find out if low dose dexamethasone is helpful, harmful, or makes no difference to the outcomes for these babies. Our early research suggests that it is helpful and with fewer side effects.
