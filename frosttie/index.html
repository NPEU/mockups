<h2 class="h2" data-varient="">About the trial</h2>

<p>FROSTTIE is a multi-centred randomised trial for babies with breastfeeding difficulties who are thought to have tongue-tie and who are receiving breastfeeding support and there is uncertainty about whether frenotomy would help continuation of breastfeeding.</p>

<p>The aim of the trial is to find out if skilled support for breastfeeding on its own, or together with a frenotomy helps mothers and their babies to breastfeed.</p>

<h2 class="h2" data-varient="">The study is currently selecting recruiting sites</h2>

<p>If you are able to provide or facilitate infant feeding support services, with a minimum breastfeeding support level of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Initial face-to-face assessment of breastfeeding;</li>
	<li>Advice on positioning and attachment;</li>
	<li>At least one follow-up visit, together with drop-in clinic advice as required, but available on more than one day a week;*</li>
	<li>A standard follow-up visit at 1-2 weeks after frenotomy;*</li>
</ul>

<p>Your site may be able to take part in this study. <em>*Please note follow-up visits do not necessarily have to take place at your trust for you to take part.</em></p>
